I do not believe you will find a more actionable book on the subject of habits and improvement. If you‚Äôre having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn‚Äôt you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves not because you don‚Äôt want to change but because you have the wrong system for change. This is one of the core philosophies of Atomic Habits: You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. In this book, you‚Äôll get a proven plan that can take you to new heights."

There are a lot of misconceptions about how to read well,  so in this video we‚Äôll cover some of the most common issues people seem to have. I can tell you now that the problem most of us have is that we learn to read books for school. And school conditions us to assume that we should be able to actively recall most things we read. We shouldn‚Äôt. Human memory doesn‚Äôt work that way. We just did that to make decent grades on the tests we took. And suck up to our teachers or whatever. I‚Äôm here to tell you to scrap everything you know. Well, not everything, but a lot of it. Reading doesn‚Äôt have to be a slow and laborious chore. I urge you to gather around. Pull up a seat. Today we‚Äôre learning better reading habits and skills. The video includes tips on reading faster, remembering what you‚Äôve read, how to read more, and some hacks on using what you‚Äôve learned, or not."
